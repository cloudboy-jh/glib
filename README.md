# glib

![glib header](./header.png)

`glib` is a terminal workspace app for repository-first development: authenticate once, pick a repo, inspect and stage changes, review beautiful diffs, and hand off to pi without leaving one UI shell.

## Why glib

AI agents are fast. Reviewing their output is the hard part.

Most terminal workflows drop you into a raw prompt with no project context loaded. You cd in, grep around, and hope the agent caught up. When it produces a diff, you're back to exiting fullscreen, hunting the file tree, scrolling to find the change — reading most of the file just to remember what it was doing.

glib fixes the workflow, not just the tooling. You pick a repo and it preloads context: commits, diffs, docs. When pi produces a change, the diff is right there — rendered by bentodiffs, one keypress to go full screen, one keypress to go back. Git, diff, and agent chat are all reachable from the same shell without breaking your mental model.

The review is the work. glib is built around that.

## Product Direction

- Repo-first UX: you start from GitHub repositories, not local filesystem spelunking.
- One workspace shell: auth, project, git, diff, and pi workflows live in one full-screen TUI.
- Best-in-class diffs: embedded `bento-diffs` renderer stays the source of truth for diff reading.
- Portable execution: local persisted workspaces or ephemeral workspaces for sandbox/container/VPS flows.
- Persistent PI sessions: soft-pause PI and resume later without losing context.

## Quick Start

```bash
go run ./cmd/glib
```

By default, `glib` ships with a built-in GitHub OAuth client id so release users can sign in immediately.

## Auth Model (Device Flow)

- `glib` uses GitHub Device Flow in-terminal.
- Default scope is `repo` (supports private repositories).
- Token is stored locally at your user config path (`<user-config-dir>/glib/github_token`).
- User settings are stored at `<user-config-dir>/glib/config.json`.
- Auth is embedded in the home/projects card under the wordmark.
- `enter` starts sign-in; `l` clears local token.

## Modes

- `PROJECTS` (`p`): GitHub repo list picker and workspace backend toggle.
- `GIT` (`g`): staged/unstaged/untracked operations with commit/push actions, branch management, and stash operations.
- `DIFF` (`d`): list-first commit history and embedded `bento-diffs` viewer with file/hunk navigation.
- `PI` (`i`): pi RPC chat/runtime in selected project directory with slash commands and session persistence.

## Workspace Backends

- `local`: clone/use repos under a persisted root (`GLIB_WORKSPACE_ROOT` or `~/glib-workspaces`).
- `ephemeral`: cached base clone + session worktree per repo.
- Ephemeral cleanup runs at app quit and skips dirty worktrees.
- Toggle backend in projects repo picker with `b`.

## PI Session Lifecycle

- PI sessions are tied to repo path and persist until `/exit`, repo change, or app quit.
- `esc` in PI does a soft pause — returns to PROJECTS without killing the process.
- Footer shows `● pi active` in PROJECTS when a session is live.
- Re-entering PI on the same repo resumes the existing session with full history intact.
- Cross-mode navigation (PI → DIFF → PI, PI → GIT → PI) preserves session state.

## Environment

- `GLIB_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: optional override for OAuth client id.
- `GLIB_WORKSPACE_ROOT`: optional root directory for local backend clones.
- `GLIB_ICONS`: icon mode (`safe` or nerd glyph defaults).

## User Settings

- Quick user settings are persisted in `<user-config-dir>/glib/config.json`.
- Theme selection is auto-saved and restored on next app launch.
- Last selected PI model is saved and applied when PI starts.

## Architecture Notes

- Unified git+diff domain internals live under `internal/bentodiffs`.
- PI transport/protocol handling lives under `internal/pi`.
- PI chat UI/session/rendering lives under `internal/piui`.
- Slash command registry lives under `internal/slash`.
- Command palette lives under `internal/command-pallette`.
- External diff rendering is provided by `github.com/cloudboy-jh/bento-diffs`.
- `glib` owns the shell/footer; embedded diff viewer footer is intentionally hidden.

## Internal Development Rules

- UI and layout rules are captured in `docs/spec.md`.
- Behavior contracts: `docs/spec.md`.
- Product roadmap: `docs/next-steps.md`.
- Complete workflow spec: `docs/glib-flow.md`.
